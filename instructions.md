Here are the high-level instructions for the other LM to implement the racing random selector:

## Core Concept
- Create a web-based random name selector that visualizes selection through a racing animation instead of a wheel
- Each participant is represented as a runner on a track
- The winner is randomly selected but revealed through an exciting race animation

## Key Features to Implement
1. **Name Entry Interface**
   - Text area for entering names (one per line)
   - Option to save/load participant lists

2. **Race Track Visualization**
   - Create a horizontal track with multiple lanes
   - Display a clear finish line on the right side
   - Represent each participant as a distinct runner (circles or simple icons)

3. **Race Animation Algorithm**
   - Implement varying speeds for each runner
   - Add randomization that creates drama (speed bursts, slowdowns)
   - Include "catch-up mechanics" so racers who fall behind have a chance to come back
   - Create a fair randomization system that predetermines the winner but keeps the race exciting

4. **Winner Celebration**
   - Clear visual/text indication of the winner
   - Optional celebration effects (confetti, sound)
   - History section to track previous winners

5. **User Experience Elements**
   - Start/reset buttons
   - Countdown before race begins
   - Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop

## Technical Approach
- Use HTML5 Canvas for the race visualization
- Pure JavaScript for the animation and logic
- CSS for styling and responsiveness
- LocalStorage for saving configurations
- No external libraries required for basic implementation

## Suggested Enhancements
- Allow customization of race length/duration
- Add sound effects (starting gun, crowd cheers)
- Include options for different race themes (sprint, marathon, obstacles)
- Implement sharing capabilities

This should give the other LM a clear framework to build from while allowing them flexibility in the technical implementation.
