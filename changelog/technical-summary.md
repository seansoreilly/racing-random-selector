### Frontend Architecture

#### HTML Structure (index.html)
- Semantic HTML5 elements (header, main, footer, section)
- Responsive viewport configuration
- Organized in logical sections:
  - Input Section (participants)
  - Race Settings
  - Race Track
  - Results Section

#### JavaScript Implementation (script.js)
1. Core Race Logic:
   - Dynamic participant initialization
   - Race animation system
   - Physics-based movement calculations
   - Collision detection
   - Finish line detection
   - Race history tracking

2. UI Components:
   - Speed control with real-time updates
   - Name input handling
   - Race track visualization
   - Dynamic lane generation
   - Background element management
   - Confetti celebration effects

3. Data Management:
   - Local storage integration for:
     - Race history
     - Participant names
     - Game settings

4. Animation Features:
   - Running dust effects
   - Character animations
   - Background element animations (butterflies, birds)
   - Smooth position transitions
   - Tether physics simulation

5. Race Mechanics:
   - Random winner selection
   - Progressive speed adjustments
   - Position tracking
