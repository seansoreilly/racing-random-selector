# Debug Changes - March 30, 2025

## Race Position Fixes

1. Fixed issue with race positions being incorrectly assigned based on lane index instead of actual race positions
   - Removed duplicate place label update code that was overwriting the correct positions
   - Modified endRace function to use sorted positions for determining last place
   - Ensured positions are consistently based on x-coordinates throughout the race

2. Changes made:
   - Removed redundant place label update code in animateRace function
   - Updated endRace function to sort participants by x-coordinate when determining winner/loser
   - Fixed loser highlighting to use actual last place participant instead of last array index

3. Technical details:
   - Place labels now update based on sortedByPosition array
   - Loser selection uses sortedByPosition[sortedByPosition.length - 1] instead of participants[participants.length - 1]
   - Removed code that was assigning positions based on array indices
# Debug Session - March 30, 2025

## Issues Identified
1. 404 error for header image due to incorrect path in index.html
2. References to non-existent buttons (resetRaceBtn and tryDemoBtn) in script.js
3. Node.js module caching issues

## Changes Made

### 1. Image Path Fix
- Modified image paths in index.html from absolute to relative paths:
  ```html
  - <source srcset="/sprites/header.png" type="image/png">
  - <img src="/sprites/header.png" alt="Racing Mascot" class="mascot-image">
  + <source srcset="sprites/header.png" type="image/png">
  + <img src="sprites/header.png" alt="Racing Mascot" class="mascot-image">
  ```

### 2. Code Cleanup
- Removed references to non-existent buttons (resetRaceBtn and tryDemoBtn)
- Updated error handling to use cleanupRace() function instead of resetRace()
- Simplified the race control logic

### 3. Server Optimization
- Added cache clearing code to server.js:
  ```javascript
  // Clear module cache
  Object.keys(require.cache).forEach(function(key) {
    delete require.cache[key];
  });
  ```

## Process
1. Initial investigation using Playwright to identify console errors
2. Analyzed and fixed image path issues
3. Cleaned up JavaScript code by removing unused button references
4. Implemented proper error handling with cleanupRace function
5. Added cache clearing to server.js for development optimization

## Node.js Cache Management
1. Tried using `node --no-cache` flag (Failed: Invalid option)
2. Attempted to kill Node processes using various commands:
   - `pkill -f node` (Failed: Command not found in Git Bash)
   - `ps -ef | grep node` (Failed: Command not found in Git Bash)
   - `TASKKILL //F //IM node.exe` (Succeeded: Successfully terminated Node processes)

## Status
- Server running on http://localhost:8000
- Image loading issues resolved
- JavaScript errors related to non-existent buttons fixed
- Node.js module caching handled through programmatic cache clearing
- All Node processes successfully managed through Windows Task Manager commands

## Feature Removal and Race Position Improvements

### 1. Removed "Show Last Place Instead of Winner" Feature
- Removed checkbox UI element from index.html
- Removed showLoserCheckbox reference from script.js
- Cleaned up isLoser parameter and related functionality from result history functions
- Simplified race result display to always show winners with trophy emoji 🏆

### 2. Race Position Display Improvements
- Modified race position behavior to persist until next race starts
- Removed automatic cleanup timeout that was clearing positions too early
- Race positions now remain visible after race completion
- Positions only clear when user starts a new race

### 3. Race Control Enhancements
- Fixed "Start Race" button to properly re-enable after race completion
- Improved race cleanup timing:
  ```javascript
  // Old: Automatic cleanup after race
  setTimeout(() => cleanupRace(), 3000);
  
  // New: Keep positions until next race
  if (allFinished) {
    clearInterval(raceInterval);
    raceInterval = null;
    startRaceBtn.disabled = false;
    speedControl.disabled = false;
    nameInput.disabled = false;
    raceInProgress = false;
  }
  ```
- Moved cleanup logic to startRace function to clear previous race only when starting a new one
